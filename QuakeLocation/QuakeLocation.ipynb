    "The next three cells plot data for three stations.  You can plot data for 8 different stations by changing the number in the function call below between 0 and 7.  I have set it up for three particular stations that result in a fairly accurate location for the earthquake, but it is quite reasonable to play with this and see how it changes the final result.  Move the slider to find the S-wave traveltime, the green line shows the time that you have it set to currently.  It sometimes takes a moment for the plot to catch up with the slider so be patient. The P-wave time is set to always be 60 seconds, but you can move that bar around as well; make sure that you understand why that is picked as the P-wave arrival.\n",
